# Quallasuyu

Checkout how the big enterprises share code in a mono-repo environment.

This has a number of front end projects written in both React and Angular, some shared UI and JavaScript libraries, and some NodeJS backend services.

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## The pros and cons of a monorepo

This section is to capture notes are we go adding, developing and using project in this NrWl monorep.  They are not definitive problems or advantages, but rather items to either be looked into (for cons) or confirmed as helpful (for pros).

These items are also specific to the NrWl/Nx approach.  I can't speak for other monorepo styles as I hvean't tried any others yet.  The closes I have gotten before is just putting related projects in one directory and opening that directory in the editor, which is not a bad way to go really.


### Pros
Ease of creating a server/client project.
The dependency graph looks great.
Changes that affect dependencies can be easy tested.

### Cons
Global search searches all the projects.
Single package.json file.


## Converting code to Typescript in NodeJS

```
const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');
```

You would think that would become this:
```
import { jwksRsa } from ('jwks-rsa');
```

But we would then get this error:
```
TS1141: String literal expected.
```

Despite this error the file still compiles and runs.  It's a TypeScript error (indicated by the TS in the error code), and in an Angular app this would break the build and the app wouldn't run.  Interesting.

This would be my next guess:
```
import * as jwksRsa from ('jwks-rsa');
```

No errors.  But we still don't really know how to use the jwksRsa Express middleware in a NestJS project.


The next challenge will be to put the check token function in the appropriate place.
```
const checkJwt = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({ ... });
})
```

The main.ts file is configured by Nest like this:
```
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
```

Other than set up the port and the global prefix, that's all that file should do.  It's the S in S.O.L.I.D.  Then, in the app module just it just sets up imports, providers (services) and controllers.

The controller class uses annotations (or decorators) no doubt Nest uses to work it's magic:
```
@Get('todos')
@Post('addTodo')
```

So, actually it seems like the main.ts file is the place where the configuration code *should* go.  Our first guess would be to just do this:
```
app.use(checkJwt);
```

Since NestJS is magic, maybe it can use it's magic to use than for API calls.  But what if we want some routes public, and some protected?

Anyhow, the app compiles, but now when using the get API, we get this runtime error:
```
UnauthorizedError: No authorization token was found
    at middleware (/Users/tim/repos/quallasuyu/node_modules/express-jwt/lib/index.js:76:21)
    at Layer.handle [as handle_request] (/Users/tim/repos/quallasuyu/node_modules/@nestjs/core/node_modules/express/lib/router/layer.js:95:5)
```

Hey, that's magic for you!~  But still, it would be nice to have an unprotected route.  Save that feature for later?

First, we will need to put actual Auth0 domain and client key in the check to see if we can then authenticate calls.  This will need a lot of front end code to get working, so stay tuned.

We will also need to use the .env library to hide our Auth0 secrets from GitHub.  How do we do that again?

Step 1: create a .env files

This goes something like this:
```
PUBLIC_KEY=...secret..
PRIVATE_KEY=...also secret...
```

Step 2: install dotenv
Our dependencies should look like this:
```
    "dependencies": {
    		"dotenv": "^7.0.0",
```

Step 3: use the secrets in NodeJS
That could look like this:
```
require('dotenv').config();
const public_key = process.env.PUBLIC_KEY;
const private_key = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
```

Except, of course we are using NestJS with TypeScript, so again, not sure what is the best practice for this.  Once again we will most likely put that in the main.ts file, but it would be a good idea to also look at some other NestJS docs to see if they have a recommendation for this type of config issue.

The next issue is that we want to check the user name passed in by the request.  Like this:
```
req.user.name
```

However, yes, you guessed it, there is no request object in the NestJS code.  It's hidden inside the NrWl/Nest magic bag.

As we know from Node best practices, a good app is a layered app.  Keeping the request objects out of the lower layers is part of this.  So, in search of the correct layer.  Or not.  Probably that property will just get passed to the response automatically so we shouldn't worry about it.

The Nest docs provide the answer.  Another decorator type arg:
```
@Get('todos')
getData(@Req() req: Request) {
  console.log('req.user.name',req.user.name);
  return this.appService.getData();
}
```

There are decorators for all the objects Express uses, such as params, next, body, query, headers, etc.

And step 4 is to put the .env in the .gitignore file so it's not pushed to the server.

Step 5 is realizing that none of that is needed because the id and domain name for the Auth0 app is actually OK to commit to the repo.  The id *looks* like a secret but it's not.  And there are no secrets on the front end, which is why OAuth was created in the first place: so some trusted organisation can provide authentication and the app trusts that organisation.


## Running on Minikube

There is a brief section about deployment in the sample code repo.  This is for Minikube which I have never heard of before.  I am however interested in Kubernetes and dev ops, so I would like to give it a try.

The docs reference two links:

- https://medium.com/@awkwardferny/getting-started-with-kubernetes-ingress-nginx-on-minikube-d75e58f52b6c
- https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learn-kubernetes-in-under-3-hours-a-detailed-guide-to-orchestrating-containers-114ff420e882

Create all the resources (deployment, services, and ingress):

```bash
kubectl apply -f resources-manifests/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f resources-manifests/backend-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f resources-manifests/frontend-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f resources-manifests/ingress.yaml
```

Then, find out the IP address of the Minikube cluster:

```bash
minikube ip
```

Finally, head to a web browser and hit the IP address returned by the command above. Also, if needed you can use the following commands to shutdown everything:

```bash
kubectl delete -f resources-manifests/deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f resources-manifests/backend-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f resources-manifests/frontend-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f resources-manifests/ingress.yaml
```

How this would work with this NrWl monorepo, I'm not sure.  Have to read those docs first.



## Fixing the Todos

While unit testing the auth guard implementation, it was noticed that our add todo function was failing, and that there is no default list of sample todos.  This is the error that shows up when choosing the add todo button.
```
body: {error: "Collection 'addTodo' not found"}
headers: HttpHeaders {normalizedNames: Map(0), lazyUpdate: null, lazyInit: ƒ}
status: 404
statusText: "Not Found"
url: "/api/addTodo"
```

The first step is actually running the API server, then run the app:
```
ng serve api
ng serve todos
```

Both calls return 404s.
```
"/api/todos"
"/api/addTodo"
status: 404
statusText: "Not Found"
```


Did this happen because we implemented the backend service for in-memory data?  The first guess is that yes, this will sabotage any APIs to our server:
```
imports: [
  ...
  InMemoryWebApiModule.forRoot(BackendService)
```

What we could do is conditionally use this if the user is offline.  Is that possible? Otherwise, get rid of that and move the contacts functionality into the backend.  Since it's just a demo, probably not worth worrying about.  The todos app is just a test bed for unit test practice, etc.

We will be creating a more serious app based on this work, so I am less concerened with this breakage right now.  The *more serious app* will use NgRx for state management, so we definately won't be needing the code for the todos except maybe as a model for tying the libraries, the API server and the front end together using nx and the monorepo style.


## Testing routing

What is the best way to setup routing with tests and all the other scaffolding stuff the cli and do.  

When creating an app, you can use a flag to generate the routing module:
```
ng new app-testing --routing
```

The docs say:
*When you generate a module, you can use the --routing option like ng g module my-module --routing to create a separate file my-module-routing.module.ts to store the module routes.  The file includes an empty Routes object that you can fill with routes to different components and/or modules.  You can use the --routing option with ng new to create a app-routing.module.ts file when you create or initialize a project.*

A bit of a tangent to get an in memory API setup and a few pages to use it.
```
 npm install --save angular-in-memory-web-api
 ng g s backend
 ng g s contact
 ng g c contact-list --frontendProject=todos
 ng g c contact-detail --frontendProject=todos
```

Setting up the [contacts](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/a-complete-guide-to-routing-in-angular/) master/detail view was fine.  However, our todo add function is broken.  The console error is:
```
body: {error: "Collection 'addTodo' not found"}
headers: HttpHeaders {normalizedNames: Map(0), lazyUpdate: null, lazyInit: ƒ}
status: 404
statusText: "Not Found"
url: "/api/addTodo"
```

Even though the server is running, the app is not hitting it.  Have to deal with that later.  On a roll with the router testing right now.

```
Unexpected value 'HttpClient' imported by the module 'DynamicTestModule'. Please add a @NgModule annotation.
```

SO: *You have to import the module HttpClientModule and reference that in the imports.*

<rant>In Javascript, why cant the test code be the same as the app code?</rant>

Then our first router testing [from this article](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/unit-testing/routing/) works like this:
```
router.navigate(['']);
tick();
expect(location.path()).toBe('/contacts');
```

The reason we test for contacts is because that is our default rout in the routing module:
```
{ path: '', pathMatch: 'full', redirectTo: 'contacts' },
```

Next, testing the detail view route.  Ignoring the contact id, the tests are taking quite a long time to run, and the top of the output in the console says:
```
console.warn node_modules/@angular/core/bundles/core.umd.js:16879
  Navigation triggered outside Angular zone, did you forget to call 'ngZone.run()'?
  ... x 4 ...
  ● Router: App › navigate to "contact" takes you to /contact
    Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'contact'
    Error: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'contact'
```

I know there are two issues here.  Since the tests are taking about a minute and a half, fixing that first would allow a saner environment for fixing the second failing test.

One solution would be to wrap the tests inside a
```
fixture.ngZone.run(() => {
  ... test ...
});
```

The solution also calls for async, while we have been using the fakeAsync.  Using a real async works well.  Or at least it seemed to.  The two tests pass.  However, adding a third test like this failed after some time:
```
Cannot find name 'async'.
```

Switching back to fakeAsync and the three tests pass in about twenty seconds.  That a lot better than the usual 80 it was taking before, but still not speedy.  I wouldn't imaging that testing routing could take so long.

Another example of using fakeAsync looks like this:
```
it("fakeAsync works", fakeAsync(() => {
    let promise = new Promise(resolve => {
      setTimeout(resolve, 10);
    });
    let done = false;
    promise.then(() => (done = true));
    tick(50);
    expect(done).toBeTruthy();
}));
```

This test passes also, but with out three tests running between 30 to 50 seconds each time, it's not ideal.  Time to look at some route guard testing.  Maybe we can speed things up with a broader range of router testing methods.

Starting off with [this article](https://atom-morgan.github.io/how-to-test-angular-canactivate-guards/).  We will create another set of routes and an auth service for this:
```
ng g component restricted
ng g component unrestricted
ng g service services/auth/auth
ng g guard guards/auth/auth
```

After running prettier fix, we have a different situation.  Since only the affected files were tested before, we didn't know what kind of things were missing from the other tests.

```
Test Suites: 6 failed, 4 passed, 10 total
Tests:       10 failed, 5 passed, 15 total
Time:        441.638s
```

Let go thru these one at a time to get them out of the way:

```

After this, I was able to get the failing tests down to between 4 to 6.  Why the variation?  

Once it was even this:
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 1 of 10 total
Tests:       1 failed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1608.621s
```

That was after importing the AppModule into the app component spec tests. If you ignore the really mysterious/buggy ones, these are the main obstacles:
```
FAIL  apps/todos/src/app/guards/auth/auth.guard.spec.ts (13.672s)
 ● Console
       ● Test suite failed to run

Those are *all* for the app.component.spec.  If we *don't* import the Todo class from the data library, then these are the errors:
```

```

Since the AuthGuard tests is still a work in progress, let's knock over the template parse errors in a way that's not going to cause other test errors.  Even though it's not used directly in that test, importing the router testing module fixes those.

The last error then is in the app.guard.spec where AuthGuard is not defined on this:
```
it('should create', inject([AuthGuard], (guard: AuthGuard) => {
  expect(guard).toBeTruthy();
}));
```

Since that's not the most important test in there, without it should pass all the tests.  But getting rid of it moves the error elsewhere.  And now we have four again.  If you fix up an issue in the AuthGuard spec, then we're getting six errors again on the app.component because of the file todo data model import.  
And the odd one out is:
```
FAIL  apps/todos/src/app/guards/auth/auth.guard.spec.ts (7.282s)
 ● AuthGuard › should create
   Component ContactListComponent is not part of any NgModule or the module has not been imported into your module.
```

This was happening a while ago.  The SO answers on this were all varied and not very helpful.

Removing the create test again and we are left only with the import @lib issue:
```
Test Suites: 1 failed, 9 passed, 10 total
Tests:       3 failed, 12 passed, 15 total
```

If you quit the test watch and run it again, you will get only the modified tests running and you can focus on those.  The last test for the auth guard is this one:
```
it('should navigate to contacts for a logged out user', () => {
  authService = { isLoggedIn: () => false };
  router = new MockRouter();
  authGuard = new AuthGuard(authService, router);
  spyOn(router, 'navigate');
  expect(authGuard.canActivate()).toEqual(false);
  expect(router.navigate).toHaveBeenCalledWith(['/']);
});
```

It changes the return value of isLoggedIn and creates an instance of the class.  It also adds a spy to the navigate method of router.  Now calling canActivate should return false and the navigate method will be called to redirect users to the root path.  

In this case it is the /contacts route.  So why do we check for /?  I guess that's just the way the Angular router works.  The translated root path doesn't show up in the test.

Running ng serve on the Angular app now has this issue:
```
ERROR in apps/todos/src/app/app.module.ts(27,5): error TS2693: 'Todo' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.
```

The data model was added to the imports of the main module to try and solve some of the errors for the app component.  Have to remove that now.
```
import { Todo } from '@myorg/data';
...
imports: [
  ...
  Todo,
```

One more thing to play with before finishing up this section is setting the auth.service to return false so that restricted is now restricted.  Create some test links in the component template and the restricted page is now restricted.

Next up, implement a real auth solution with AWS Cognito!


## 100 Days of React

This is an Instagram, Slack extraveganza of React learning.  Below are some of the projects and challenges.


### Week 1
Miniflix challenge.

### Week 2
Hooks todos.


### Week 3
Auth0.

### Week 4
Elasticsearch.


## Auth0

This is the week 3 challenge which uses Auth0 to secure routes.

To secure the Node.js API we use these two libraries:
* express-jwt: A middleware that validates a JSON Web Token (JWT) and set the req.user with its attributes.
* jwks-rsa: A library to retrieve RSA public keys from a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint.

To secure the React application with Auth0, yinstall only one library:
* auth0-js:  the official library provided by Auth0


### Setup for the backend includes creating an Express "check Jwt" middleware object that will validate ID tokens with this kind of info:
```
secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
  cache, rateLimit: true, jwksRequestsPerMinute, jwksUri
  // Validate the audience and the issuer.
  audience: CLIENT_ID, issuer: `https://<AUTH0_DOMAIN>/`, algorithms
```

The Client ID and Domain field are from the Auth0 dashboard.  Then make the endpoints to secure use the check Jwt middleware like this:
```
app.post('/', checkJwt, (req, res) => {
```

Then you can use the user name like this:
```
author: req.user.name,
```

### Setup for the frontend includes using only one library:
```
npm install auth0-js
```

Then create a helper class with these functions:
```Javascript
import auth0 from 'auth0-js';
class Auth {
  constructor() {
    this.auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
      // the following three lines MUST be updated
      domain: '<AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
      audience: 'https://<AUTH0_DOMAIN>/userinfo',
      clientID: '<AUTH0_CLIENT_ID>',
      redirectUri: 'http://localhost:3000/callback',
      responseType: 'id_token',
      scope: 'openid profile'
    });
    this.getProfile = this.getProfile.bind(this);
    this.handleAuthentication = this.handleAuthentication.bind(this);
    this.isAuthenticated = this.isAuthenticated.bind(this);
    this.signIn = this.signIn.bind(this);
    this.signOut = this.signOut.bind(this);
  }
  getProfile() {  }
  getIdToken() {  }
  isAuthenticated() {  }
  signIn() {  }
  handleAuthentication() {  }
  signOut() {  }
}
const auth0Client = new Auth();
```

(After setting up the backend which included installing the dotenv lib to hide the Auth0 secrets from GitHub, how do we hide these secrets in the front end?  When the app is deployed, there will be server settings which are service depedant.  But locally, can the front end also use that lib to get the secrets in the .env file?  Looks like we can do the same thing we did in the Node app in the frontend also.)

Somewhere like the navbar, this:
```
{
  !auth0Client.isAuthenticated() &&
  <button className="btn btn-dark" onClick={auth0Client.signIn}>Sign In</button>
}
{
  auth0Client.isAuthenticated() &&
  <div>
    <label className="mr-2 text-white">{auth0Client.getProfile().name}</label>
    <button className="btn btn-dark" onClick={() => {signOut()}}>Sign Out</button>
  </div>
}
```

A component is then needed to handle the callback route ```http://localhost:3000/callback``` is needed.
```
async componentDidMount() {
  await auth0Client.handleAuthentication();
  this.props.history.replace('/');
}
```

It shows a message while fetching the user info and then redirects to the home page after it finishes.

It is used in the App.js file like this:
```
<Route exact path='/callback' component={Callback}/>
```

To add protected routes a helper class can be used.  It is a functional component that takes a Component, so it can render it in case the user is authenticated, and a path so it can configure the default Route component provided by React Router. First it checks if the user isAuthenticated, and either redirects to login or renders the component passed in.
```
SecuredRoute(props) {
  const {component: Component, path} = props;
  return (
    <Route path={path} render={() => {
        if (!auth0Client.isAuthenticated()) {
          auth0Client.signIn();
          return <div></div>;
        }
        return <Component />
    }} />
  );
}
```

Then in the App.js file, we can use that route like this:
```
<SecuredRoute path='/new-question' component={NewQuestion} />
```

And provide a link somewhere:
```
<Link to="/new-question">
```

The SubmitAnswer class does this to submit an answer to a question:
```
submit() {
    this.props.submitAnswer(this.state.answer);
```

In the Question class, this handles the event and provides the axios.post functionality:
```
class Question extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    this.submitAnswer = this.submitAnswer.bind(this);
  }
```

It's not very clear how the props are used to handle the submit function.  The clear explanation will have to wait for now.

### Adding the Q&A code to the todo apps

The todo app is a simple one file affair.  The Q&A app is layered using better practices.  Some of the files needed are:
```
Auth.js
NavBar.js
Callback.js
```

Using Callback in the App.tsx shows the first big difference.  The todo app doesn't use routing.  Further work includes:
```
SecuredRoute/SecuredRoute.js
NewQuestion/NewQuestion.js
register the new route in your App.js file:
Questions.js
question/SubmitAnswer.js
```

The main issue then is merging the two apps within the app.tsx file with the code from the App.js file in the Q&A sample.

The app structure however consists of just directories with a single file and the same name as their containing files.  What I recommend is a single directory called Q&A.  Can you put & in a directory and paths?  Called it q_and_a for now.

Next, the todo app is build on hooks.  The Q&A app is build with classes.  Is it a good idea to try and mix the two?  It's a good exercise for a senior and I can answer my own question.

### The port number

The sample app uses localhost:8081 for the API server.  Using NrWl, we run:
```
ng serve api
...
Listening at http://localhost:3333/api
```

So then if we use curl to look at the server we get this:
```
curl localhost:3333
UnauthorizedError: No authorization token was found
    at middleware (/Users/tim/repos/quallasuyu/node_modules/express-jwt/lib/index.js:76:21)
```

All the routes are protected now by out auth middleware.  If we do login, we will also need to replace 8081 with 3333 in places that use Axios for http calls within the app such as Quststion, Questions, NewQuestion.

On the Auth0 dashboard, we have set *Allowed Callback URLs*, *Allowed Logout URLs* and *Allowed Web Origins* as http://localhost:3000.

Now, with the changes in place, the page loads and we get this error:
```
Request URL: http://localhost:3333/
Request Method: GET
Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error
```

Trying the login button out returns:
```
This site can’t be reached https’s server IP address could not be found.
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
```

Then I notice this:
```
https://https//hakea.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=7MlVhNgye9YsRstn0yLtydbkSc3FZi1p&response_type=id_token&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fcallback&scope=openid%20profile&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fhakea.auth0.com%2Fuserinfo&state=A4nBa-JEBiFB4gpi8wj8Bu5s0cxEI.vZ&nonce=tZFg-ob~qhENKXP2QnycVn8CYwv49~xa&auth0Client=eyJuYW1lIjoiYXV0aDAuanMiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoiOS4xMC4yIn0%3D
```

As Jamie Hyderman says: "We'll, there's yr' problem!"

On the server, our AUTH0_DOMAIN = 'hakea.auth0.com'.  Both occurances of that variable appear *with* the https string in index.js.  For us, that's the main.ts file.

In the front end, that string appears both with and without the https string.
```
domain: '<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>',
audience: 'https://<YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN>/userinfo',
```

No where are we adding 'authorize' to the string, so it is being created in either the express-jwt or the jwks-rsa libraries.

In main.ts, trying it like this without the https:
```
jwksUri: AUTH0_DOMAIN+'/.well-known/jwks.json'
```

Doing that changes the error message.  Had to add this full url with the callback string to the allowed callbacks field in the Auth0 dashboard like this:
```
http://localhost:3000/callback
```

Then we are back to an error, this time with the url showing:
```
http://localhost:3000/callback#error=access_denied&error_description=Service%20not%20found%3A%20hakea.auth0.com%2Fuserinfo&state=HAIhy8zp5dDC4bjf_gwzjsds~8Yj8jCT
```





## To-Do App with React Hooks

The week two challenge is more realistic.  It's a 100% hooks todo list from [another Scotch.io article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components).

Instead of using create-react-app direcly, we use the nx command to start the project:
```
ng g app hooks-todo --framework=react
```

It calls for:
```
npm i react@16.7.00alpha.2 react-dom@16.7.0-alpha.2
```

We already have React 16.8 in our global package.json file.  That's right, a global package.json file.  It has everything for all of the projects.  It feels a little uncomfortable doing it this way, and seems to be breaking some kind of un-written rule that each project has its own package.  I suppose tree-shaking takes care of only including the used packages during deploy.

The article links to a writeup on array destructuring if you want to know more info about the [todos, setTodos] syntax [here](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-react-hooks#toc-what-is-this-usestate-syntax-).

### object destructuring vs array destructuring

*object destructuring*
```
const users = { admin: 'chris', user: 'nick' };

// grab the admin and user but rename them to SuperAdmin and SuperUser
const { admin: SuperAdmin, user: SuperUser } = users;
```

*array destructuring*
```
const users = ['chris', 'nick'];

// grab in order and rename at the same time
const [SuperAdmin, SuperUser] = users;
```


However, running the app stirs up these console errors:
```
Warning: React.createElement: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
warningWithoutStack @ react.development.js:188
react-dom.development.js:62 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
    at invariant (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:1751:29)
```

The same code ran in it's own project created the normal way.  Anyhow, I won't bore you with any other details, but the src/main.tsx file had to change its import from this:
```
import { App } from './app/app';
```

to this:
```
import App from './app/app';
```

After finishing the CRUD functions, I decided to add a select action that would let the user choose an item to display in another section of the app.  A basic master/detail pattern thingy.

Using a hook, it works like this:
```
function Todo({ todo, index, completeTodo, removeTodo, selectTodo }) {
  return (
    <div className="todo">
      <div onClick={() => selectTodo(index)}>{todo.text}</div>
      ...
function App() {
  const [todo, setTodo] = useState({});
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([ ... ]);
  const addTodo = text => { };
  const completeTodo = index => { };
  const removeTodo = index => { };
  const selectTodo = index => {
    setTodo(todos[index]);
  };
  return (
    <div className="app">
      ...
        <div className="selectedTodo">{todo.text}</div>
```

That's a pretty nice skeleton of functionality to hang an app off if you ask me.

To do (pun intended) is to clear the selected item when

Next we want to use Fetch or Axium to get our data from an API.


## Miniflix challenge

The code for this section lives in the minflex branch on Github.

Since this is an nx mono-repo project (many apps, one repo), we use the nx commands.  So instead of running this line from the [challenge](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mini-netflix-with-react-in-10-minutes):
```
create-react-app miniflix
```

We will run this line:
```
ng g app miniflix --framework=react
```

Ng is the Angular CLI, but notice we can use that power with React apps also.

p.s.  If you are curious about using nx to build an enterprise-class React (or other frontend/backend/full-stack) projects, checkout [this article](https://blog.nrwl.io/powering-up-react-development-with-nx-cf0a9385dbec).

Add [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (just remember Bootstrap is considered dangerous for serious projects).

Install these:
```
auth0-js react-router@3.0.0 jwt-decode axios
```

[jwt-decode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) is a *jwt-decode is a small browser library that helps decoding JWTs token which are Base64Url encoded.*


Axios is an http lib.  I usually reach for Fetch, but Axios is pretty popular these days.

Next, and Auth0 lib which reveals what I'm assuming is the completed project [here](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/miniflix/blob/master/src/utils/AuthService.js).

The [linked to tutorial](https://github.com/auth0-blog/reactjs-authentication-tutorial) on Auth0 which I've used before with Angular I'm assuming will provide details of how to setup an Auth0 account and fill in the details needed to use Auth0:
```
const ID_TOKEN_KEY = 'id_token';
const ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY = 'access_token';
const CLIENT_ID = 'EeobY3jxsMoFREmqfmsZwAALQb73WeWm';
const CLIENT_DOMAIN = 'unicoder.auth0.com';
const REDIRECT = 'http://localhost:3000/callback';
const SCOPE = 'full:access';
const AUDIENCE = 'http://miniflix.com';
```

I would say that the hype at the beginning of the Scotch.io article which talks about 10 minutes from now as the finish time is now exposed as false.  Actually they sat the *app be ready in 8 minutes*.  Sure it will.  Nice clickbait.

The challenge is still valid.  When looking for my last role, I had quite a few tests like this that lasted anywhere from 100 on HackerRank to 3 or 4 hours of open ended implementations.

Rant over, there are some differences in the project structure created by nx and create-react-app.

### apps/miniflix/
```
src/app/app.tsx
```

### src/
```
index.js
```

In Nav.js:
```
import './app.css';
```

to this:
```
import '../app.scss';
```


When the tutorial says *open up index.js and add replace it with the code here*, we put that into src/app/app.tsx.

Then, when we run our project we have to specify which app to run in this mono-reopo world we created like this:
```
ng serve miniflix
```

### The service worker error

Running the app we get this error:
```
Failed to compile.
./app/app.tsx
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './registerServiceWorker' in '/Users/tim/angular/myorg/apps/miniflix/src/app'
```

You might think that problems like this would inspire use to just follow along with the basic example and use create-react-app instead of a mono-repo built with nx.  Well, a little, but since I am trying to learn about using nx with all kinds of projects, this is a great way to get familiar with the workflow and the kinds of problems that arise during development.

If that line 23 of the app.tsx code is commented out:
```
//registerServiceWorker();
```

On the [Slack channel](https://code100days.slack.com/messages/DJ3DSR2RL/convo/CHJF83RPC-1555875663.326800/) Lenora Porter points out: *According to the article, the serviceWorker is called using*
```
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';
```
*and called again at the bottom of index.js with*
```
registerServiceWorker();
```
*I believe this is an old way of doing things.  Use this instead:*
```
import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
```
*and then*
```
serviceWorker.unregister();
```

### Cannot read property 'func' of undefined

After dealing with the service worker problem the error changes to this:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'func' of undefined
    at Object.../../../node_modules/react-router/lib/PropTypes.js (PropTypes.js:8)
```

Going to clone the finished [repo here](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/miniflix.git) and see if it will run.  Actually, after reading the comments at the end of the Scoth.io article, I'm not going to bother.  Also, on the Slack channel, Tyrique Daniel said *noone found a fix will start a new tut tomorrow will share with the group*.

But, no, I don't like to give up so easy.  I want to know if that second function above is due to old router code.

The tutorial shows installing an exact version:
```
react-router@3.0.0
```

However, if we install it ourselves without the version number, we get:
```
react-router@3.2.1
```

But then the serve returns this runtime error (and warning that was maybe there before):
```
react-dom.development.js:62 Uncaught Invariant Violation: Target container is not a DOM element.
    at invariant (http://localhost:4200/vendor.js:4700:29)
    ...

```

## Managing state

Managing state is a hard problem. Things that update the state concurrently need to coordinated:
* multiple backends
* web workers
* UI components

What should we store in memory, in the URL, or local UI state? How do we synchronize the persistent state, the URL, and the state on the server?

Types of states:
* Server state
* Persistent state
* The URL and router state
* Client state
* Transient client state
* Local UI state


It’s a good practice to reflect both the persistent and client state in the URL.
This is transient client state is not captured in this way.

Questions that can be asked about frontend state are:
Can it be shared? What is its lifetime.

Since the user can always interact with the URL directly, we should treat the router as the source of truth and the initiator of actions. The router should invoke the reducer

StoreRouterConnectingModule parses the URL and creates a router state snapshot. It then invokes the reducer with the snapshot, and only after the reducer is done it proceeds with the navigation.

The [example repo](https://github.com/vsavkin/state_management_ngrx4) shows how to implement the store router module connecting the reducer and its store to the router.  It follows the walkthrough in [this article](https://blog.nrwl.io/using-ngrx-4-to-manage-state-in-angular-applications-64e7a1f84b7b) by Victor Savkin, a co-founder of Nrwl used in this monotheistic project.



## Starting out

These are the commands walked thru by [the official nx articule](https://nx.dev/tutorial/12-summary).  There are also some variants on this list for demonstrative purposes.
```
npx create-nx-workspace myorg // create a new workspace
ng g app todos // create the Angular app
ng g app reactapp --framework=react // React
ng serve todos // start it up
ng e2e todos-e2e --watch // run the e2e tests
ng g node-app api --frontendProject=todos // create the node app
ng g s backend --frontendProject=todos // create the node app
yarn ng generate node-app --name=api --framework=nestjs --no-interactive
ng serve api // serve the app
ng build api // build the app
ng test api // test the app
ng g lib data // create shared interfaces
ng g lib ui // create ui lib
ng g component todos --project=ui --export
```
restart after ui lib changes
```
ng serve api
ng serve todos
```

Look at what has changed in the projects.
```
npm run affected:apps -- --base=master
npm run affected:libs -- --base=master
run affected:test -- --base=master // retest all the affected projects.
npm run affected:test -- --base=master --only-failed // retest the failed projects.
npm run affected:test -- --base=master --parallel // test all projects in parallel
npm run affected:build -- --base=master // By default, Nx builds libraries in the context of some application. mark a library as publishable to change it
npm run affected -- --target=build --base=master //  run any target against the affected projects in the graph
```

Affected commands Nx provides are:
```
affected:e2e // Runs E2E test for affected projects.
affected:lint // Lints affected projects.
affected:apps // Lists all affected apps.
affected:libs // Lists all affected libs.
affected:build // Builds all affected apps.
```


## The dep-graph


```
yarn dep-graph // generate the dependency graph which will open in a browser
yarn affected:dep-graph --base=master // affected nodes/paths highlighted in red
```

If an app depends on the api since it makes requests to it, modify nx.json to show this.

In nx.json, under projects, add an implicitDependencies section for the app.
```
  "projects": {
    "my-app": {
      "implicitDependencies": ["api"],
      "tags": []
    },
```



## Prettier
```
yarn format:check // Checks if files are formatted correctly.
yarn format:write // Updates files with correct formatting.
yarn lint
yarn test
yarn e2e --watch
```


## React commands

Use ```-dry-run``` to preview the changes before committing them.
```
yarn ng generate lib --name=home --no-interactive --framework=react
yarn add react-router react-router-dom
npm install react-router react-router-dom // npm version
yarn ng generate lib --name=gifs --no-interactive --framework=react
yarn add axios # Install HTTP client
```


## Styled-components schematic

The usual process goes like this:
1. Install styled-components as a dependency.
2. Create a new file for the component manually.
3. Create a test file for the component manually.
4. Add an entry to the index.ts file of the module.

Use a workspace schematic to automate this process.
```
yarn ng generate workspace-schematic react-component
```

Then, using parts of the @angular-devkit/schematics, @angular-devkit/core and @nrwl/schematics/src/utils/ast-utils libraries, create the boilerplate code in tools/schematics/react-component/index.ts.

You can see an example implementation [here](https://github.com/nrwl/react-nx-example/tree/master/tools).


## Can't resolve and not a module errors

Out of the box we were getting this error:
```
ERROR in apps/todos/src/app/app.component.ts(3,22):
error TS2306: File '...index.ts' is not a module.
libs/ui/src/lib/todos/todos.component.ts(2,22):
error TS2306: File '...index.ts' is not a module.
```

The file is just an interface.  However, it wasn't being exported.  Easy fix.

This happened again when adding the Giphy sample.  Alright, it's a slightly different error.
```
ERROR in ./app/app.tsx
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@my-app/gifs' in '/Users/tim/angular/myorg/apps/react-demo/src/app'
 @ ./app/app.tsx 5:0-36 18:105-109
 @ ./main.tsx
 @ multi (webpack)-dev-server/client?http://0.0.0.0:0 ./main.tsx
```

```
$ npm run affected:build -- --base=master
...
ERROR in apps/todos/src/app/app.module.ts(13,3): error TS2345: Argument of type '{ declarations: (typeof AppComponent)[]; imports: (typeof UiModule | typeof BrowserModule)[]; providers: undefined[]; bootstrap: (typeof AppComponent)[]; shemas: any[]; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'NgModule'.
  Object literal may only specify known properties, but 'shemas' does not exist in type 'NgModule'. Did you mean to write 'schemas'?
apps/todos/src/app/app.module.ts(13,12): error TS2304: Cannot find name 'CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA'.
```

The following issue appears to be about to be resolved:
[fix(frontend): tsconfig paths resolution #1233](https://github.com/nrwl/nx/pull/1233)

A comment 13 days ago says *all Tsconfig paths should work*.  I should hope so.  However, it mentions paths with an asterix, not an '@', so maybe these issues are not related?




## Fixing the tests

```
FAIL  apps/todos/src/app/app.component.spec.ts (140.066s)
 AppComponent
   ✕ should create the app (4214ms)
   ✕ should have as title 'todos' (22ms)
   ✕ should render title in a h1 tag (20ms)
 ● AppComponent › should create the app
   Template parse errors:
   Can't bind to 'todos' since it isn't a known property of 'myorg-todos'.
```

Add Todo from '@myorg/data' to the imports and we get a different error.
```
ReferenceError: Todo is not defined
```

It is imported like this:
```
import { Todo } from '@myorg/data';
```

The '@' symbol indicates a scoped name.  That prefix allows related mpm packages to be grouped under a folder with that prefix to avoid polluting the node_modules.


Other failing tests probably related to the first failure:
```
● AppComponent › should create the app
  Illegal state: Could not load the summary for directive AppComponent.
    at syntaxError (../../../packages/compiler/src/util.ts:100:17)
```


## Creating the React apps

Changing my-app to react-demo.  [Source](https://blog.nrwl.io/powering-up-react-development-with-nx-cf0a9385dbec)
```
ng g app react-demo
yarn start
yarn ng generate lib --name=home --no-interactive --framework=react

yarn add react-router react-router-dom
npm install react-router react-router-dom
// (done) update our app component and styles

yarn ng generate lib --name=gifs --no-interactive --framework=react
yarn add axios // Install HTTP client
//  implement a Giphy search

// (done) to use the Gifs component from the app, update app.tsx
// (done) update environment.ts with the Giphy entry.

ng build my-app --prod // generate assets so that it can be served statically
```

## Old Documentation

Part of the automatically generated docs.

```
ng g app myapp` to generate an application. When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same CLI workspace.
ng serve myapp` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
ng e2e
ng generate component component-name --project=myapp` to generate a new component. You can also ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
ng build myapp` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://karma-runner.github.io).
ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](http://www.protractortest.org/).
